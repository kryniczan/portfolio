# About me
I am a Quality Assurance Engineer and I am actively gaining knowledge in this area. I can create test cases based on specifications, perform manual tests, and and prepare bug reports. I've worked on the program's instructions several times. I have well-developed analytical and communication skills. I understand the SDLC and STLC processes, and the way of working in the scrum environment is not a mystery to me.
